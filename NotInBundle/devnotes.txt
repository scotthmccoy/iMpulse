TODO:
One potential complication - You can put the controller into MAW mode but the iOS app is simply not going to be able to tell when you released a key.



DONE: state machine for basic keys, test for both players
TODO: map arrow keys into state machine (Not doable since arrow keys don't have an upstate, even on iOS)
TODO: map media keys into state machine (not doable since media keys don't have an upstate)
TODO: art. Download cocos2d.



For the state machine, when it's in MAW mode, we don't have key up events. So tracking the state is worthless.

How do I want to store the state? Two arrays? More dictionaries?
This should be as fast as possible.
